# HeuristicSudokuSolver

This projecet implements a sudoku solver using **heuristic optimization algorithms**. 

This project investigates two different heuristic optimization algorithms: _Ant Colony Optimization_ and _Particle Swarm Optimization_. 

The goal is to compare the solving times of Sudoku puzzles using these algorithms, highlighting their efficiency and effectiveness in tackling combinatorial problems.
