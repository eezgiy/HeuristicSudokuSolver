# Particle Swarm Optimization

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of birds or fish. 
It is used to solve complex optimization problems by mimicking the way individuals in a swarm (or group) communicate and move toward better solutions.
Here’s an overview of how PSO works:

# Key Concepts of PSO:

**Particles:**

In PSO, potential solutions to the optimization problem are represented as "particles." Each particle has a position in the solution space and a velocity that determines how it moves through that space.

**Swarm:**

A group of particles is called a swarm. All particles in the swarm work collaboratively to find the best solution.

**Fitness Evaluation:**

Each particle’s position is evaluated using a fitness function, which measures how good the solution is. The goal is to maximize or minimize this fitness value, depending on the problem.
